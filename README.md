## (1) Description

A personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of simple games. I used trial and error and ChatGPT prompting. This was built with React, react-spring, styled components, react-player, Node, Javascript, and CSS. 

This has a basic attempt at a slot machine (incomplete), and working react music player loaded with several test songs.

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/slot-machine.git
cd slot-machine
npm install
npm run start
```

## (5) Usage

Technologies:

+ - <strong>react-spring: </strong> animation smoothing, add tension, friction through 'animated divs' (customized through shipStyle, projectileStyle, and asteroidStyle).
+ Styled components (slot machine)
+ react-player (music player)

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

The main functions of code:

- React-player has a default appearance, which was changed, setting controls={false} and making useStates to control volume, song progress bar, song time, etc.

## (7) Alternative Config

xxx :
```bash
const ;
```

## (8) Bugs and Further Development: 

- slot images stop out of alignment

Optimization:
- use react-virtualized to only render visible stuff
- once game basically running, convert it into Redux or Zustand
- use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to optimize build output: Enable code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- Consider memoizing components like Projectile and Particle using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if their props rarely change.

## (9) To do: 

- [x] create slot boxes
- [x] insert graphics/emojis 
- [x] make slots spin
- [ ] align images 
- [ ] user gets points
- [ ] user spends points to spin
